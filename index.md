**# About**

I am a PhD candidate in [Communications](https://www.upf.edu/web/comunicacio) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, funded by a PIPF-UPF grant. My doctoral research, supervised by [Prof. Pilar Medina Bravo](https://www.upf.edu/web/master-investigacio-comunicacio/profesorat/-/asset_publisher/Bm5dQSWD0KaM/content/medina-bravo-pilar/35446147/maximized), focuses on a critical approach to sentiment analysis. I hold an M.Res in [Cognitive Systems and Interactive Media](https://www.upf.edu/web/master-universitari-sistemes-cognitius-mitjans-interactius) from UPF and a B.Eng in Telecommunications from ULPGC. I use she/her pronouns.

My research sits at the intersection of Science and Technology Studies, Gender studies and Marxism, combining technical expertise in programming and data analysis with critical frameworks. The first of my two broad strands of research examines how machine learning models embed ideological assumptions, with particular focus on Sentiment Analysis and its societal implications. A second strand is focused on the political economy of AI, exploring how the commodification of data and the role of large tech companies shape our understanding of AI technologies.

I have several publications under review in journals including Science as Culture, AI & Society, and Science & Society, and have presented at international conferences such as the PSA Annual Conference and the Danish Society for Marxist Studies. I have also done talks with cultural collectives and institutions such as the Ateneu Barcelon√©s and Crudo.

If of any interest, here are my [CV](assets/files/donafalcon_cv.pdf) and my [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0009-0006-4376-7000).
